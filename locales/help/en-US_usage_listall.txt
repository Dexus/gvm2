----------------------
Without any options source (-s|--source) is selected by default. Only bonafide
releases are listed: legacy "weekly" and "release" tags are omitted. The source
list is filtered to only include versions that can be built on the running
platform. The binary list is filtered to only include versions that should have
a binary package available for the running platform.
