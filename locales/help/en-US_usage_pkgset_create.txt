Usage: gvm pkgset create [option] <pkgset>

Create a new package set for the currently selected Go version

Options:
    -l, --local                 Create in current directory
    -f, --force                 Skip prompts and bypass sanity checks
        --porcelain             Machine-readable output
    -q, --quiet                 Suppress progress messages
    -h, --help                  Show this message

Command line arguments
----------------------
When the -l | --local option is specified, the new package set will be created
in the current working directory, however, the package set will still depend on
a Go version installed under the standard GVM_ROOT directory.

The -f | --force option should not generally be used as it will skip some sanity
checks including a check for the use of reserved names.
