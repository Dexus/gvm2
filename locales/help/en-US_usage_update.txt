Command line arguments
----------------------
If the <version> is not specified, the latest GVM version will be used.

Old versions
------------
It is possible to switch to an older version of GVM2; however, if you switch to
a version that does not support the update command you will need to manually
intervene to update to newer versions. A prompt will be presented to confirm any
attempt to switch to a version that does not support updates but this prompt can
be disabled by specifying the -f|--force option.

Unless the <version> specified does not support update functionality there
will be no further prompting.
