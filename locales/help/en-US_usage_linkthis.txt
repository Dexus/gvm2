Usage: gvm linkthis [option] [<package>]

Create a link from the GVM2 pkgset src directory to a working source directory

Options:
        --porcelain             Machine-readable output
    -q, --quiet                 Suppress progress messages
    -h, --help                  Show this message

The working source directory is typically the project directory in which you are
writing your code.

Linking from your pkgset src directory allows the Go build process to properly
resolve the packages you are building among other package dependencies while
isolating the installation of all third-party packages within the pkgset itself.

Command line arguments
----------------------
If the <package> is not specified, a link will be created from the pkgset src
directory to the current base directory:

    prompt> gvm linkthis

Usually, you will want to specify a longer package name that includes the git
repo path:

    prompt> gvm linkthis github.com/<USERNAME>/<PACKAGE>

For instance, the first invocation style will work if your pkgset includes a
dependent package named "gotest":

    import (
            "fmt"

            "gotest"
    )

Usually, packages are contained within repo paths:

    import (
            "fmt"

            "github.com/<USERNAME>/gotest"
    )

Therefore, the second invocation style is the one that most developers will use.
