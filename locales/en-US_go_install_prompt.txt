It doesn't look like Go has been installed. Follow these steps to begin:

       1) Use 'gvm listall' to select a go version
       2) Use 'gvm install <version>' to build from source.**
          - or -
          Use 'gvm install <version> --binary' to install a binary.
       3) Then use 'cd .' or 'gvm use <version>'.

**In most cases, you should install go1.4 first to build later versions.
